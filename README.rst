About

*A semantically annotated parallel corpus for English, German, Dutch and
Italian!*

The Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB), developed at the `University of Groningen
<http://www.rug.nl>`__ and building upon the `Groningen Meaning Bank
<http://gmb.let.rug.nl/>`__, comprises sentences and texts in raw and tokenised
format, syntactic analysis, word senses, thematic roles, reference resolution,
and formal meaning representations. The main objective of the PMB is to provide
fine-grained meaning representations for words, sentences and texts. Sentences
are, in isolation, often ambiguous. In the PMB we aim to provide the most
likely interpretation for a sentence, with a minimal use of underspecification.

The current (development) version of the PMB is accessible via the `PMB
Explorer <explorer>`__. You are welcome to contribute to the PMB by providing
corrections to existing linguistic annotations in a wiki-like environment.
Anyone can register via the `PMB Explorer <explorer>`__ and check, improve, or
discuss linguistic annotations. Released data can be downloaded from the `data
<data.php>`__ page.

The PMB is developed at the `University of Groningen <http://www.rug.nl>`__ as
part of the NWO vici project "Lost in Translation -- Found in Meaning" (Project
number 277-89-003), led by Johan Bos (2015-2020). The `logo
<http://pmb.let.rug.nl/img/logo.png>`__ for the PMB was designed by `Sara
BÃ¡rcena <http://www.sarabarcena.com>`__ and `Valerio Basile
<https://valeriobasile.github.io>`__. On special occasions the PMB is decorated
with special logos, for instance `this
<http://pmb.let.rug.nl/img/xmas_logo.png>`__ logo designed by `Lasha Abzianidze
<https://sites.google.com/site/lashabzianidze/home>`__ for introducing a
special Christmas feeling.

Discourse Representation Structures, Semantic Tags, and Semantic Derivations
(coming soon!).
